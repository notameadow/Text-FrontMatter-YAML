Text::FrontMatter::YAML - read the "YAML front matter" format

DESCRIPTION

Text::FrontMatter::YAML opens files with so-called "YAML front matter",
such as are found on GitHub (and used in Jekyll, and various other
programs). It's a way of associating metadata with a file by marking off
the metadata into a YAML section at the top of the file.

The YAML front matter can be retrieved as a hash or as a string, and the
file data below can be retrieved as a string, or via a filehandle.
Access is read-only.


SYNOPSIS

    use Text::FrontMatter::YAML;

    my $filepath = shift(@ARGV);
    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        path => $filepath,
    );

    my $hashref = $tfm->get_frontmatter_hash();
    my $mumble  = $hashref->{'mumble'};

    my $fh = $tfm->get_data_fh();
    while (defined(my $line = <$fh>)) {
        # do something with the file data
    }

    # or also...

    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        string => $text_with_frontmatter
    );

    my $yaml = $tfm->get_frontmatter_text();
    my $data = $tfm->get_data_text();


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This release only supports reading the data. I haven't yet needed
read/write ability, so I haven't written it. If you would find it
helpful, please let me know (or send a patch).

Text encoding is not currently considered. I hope to handle the division
between YAML front matter and document text sanely and correctly in
the future. Suggestions welcome.


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
