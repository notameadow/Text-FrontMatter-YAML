Text::FrontMatter::YAML 

DESCRIPTION

Text::FrontMatter::YAML opens files with so-called "YAML front matter",
such as are found on GitHub (and used in Jekyll, and various other
programs). It's a way of associating metadata with a file by marking off
the metadata into a YAML section at the top of the file.

The YAML front matter can be retrieved as a hash or as a string, and the
file data below can be retrieved as a string, or via a filehandle.
Access is read-only.

SYNOPSIS

    use Text::FrontMatter::YAML;

    my $filepath = shift(@ARGV);
    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        path => $filepath,
    );

    my $hashref     = $tfm->get_frontmatter_hash();
    my $data_format = $hashref->{'format'};

    my $fh = $tfm->get_data_fh();
    while (defined(my $line = <$fh>)) {
        # do something with the file data
    }

    ...

    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        string => $text_with_frontmatter
    );

    my $yaml = $tfm->get_frontmatter_text();
    my $data = $tfm->get_data_text();


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This release only supports reading the data. I'm not sure there's much
call for read-write access; files with YAML front matter tend to be used
by website engines for geeks, so they tend to be manually created.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Text::FrontMatter::YAML
