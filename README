Text::FrontMatter::YAML - read the "YAML front matter" format

DESCRIPTION

Text::FrontMatter::YAML opens files with so-called "YAML front matter",
such as are found on GitHub (and used in Jekyll, and various other
programs). It's a way of associating metadata with a file by marking off
the metadata into a YAML section at the top of the file.

The YAML front matter can be retrieved as a hash or as a string, and the
file data below can be retrieved as a string, or via a filehandle.
Access is read-only.


SYNOPSIS

    use File::Slurp;
    use Text::FrontMatter::YAML;

    # READING
    my $text_with_frontmatter = read_file("filename.md");
    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        document_string => $text_with_frontmatter
    );

    my $hashref  = $tfm->frontmatter_hashref;
    my $mumble   = $hashref->{'mumble'};
    my $data     = $tfm->data_text;

    # or also

    my $fh = $tfm->data_fh();
    while (defined(my $line = <$fh>)) {
        # do something with the file data
    }

    # WRITING
    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        frontmatter_hashref => {
            title => 'The first sentence of the "Gettysburg Address"',
            author => 'Abraham Lincoln',
            date => 18631119
        },
        data_text => "Four score and seven years ago...",
    );

    write_file("gettysburg.md", $tfm->document_string);


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Text::FrontMatter::YAML uses YAML::Tiny. Perhaps it would be useful to
support more than one YAML module. Perhaps that would be more trouble
that it's worth. Thoughts?
