Text::FrontMatter::YAML - read the "YAML front matter" format

DESCRIPTION

Text::FrontMatter::YAML opens files with so-called "YAML front matter",
such as are found on GitHub (and used in Jekyll, and various other
programs). It's a way of associating metadata with a file by marking off
the metadata into a YAML section at the top of the file.

The YAML front matter can be retrieved as a hash or as a string, and the
file data below can be retrieved as a string, or via a filehandle.
Access is read-only.


SYNOPSIS

    use Text::FrontMatter::YAML;

    my $tfm = Text::FrontMatter::YAML->new(
        from_string => $text_with_frontmatter
    );

    my $hashref  = $tfm->frontmatter_hashref();
    my $mumble   = $hashref->{'mumble'};
    my $data     = $tfm->data_text();

    # or also

    my $fh = $tfm->data_fh();
    while (defined(my $line = <$fh>)) {
        # do something with the file data
    }


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This release only supports splitting a document string into the front
matter and data sections. I haven't yet needed to go the other way so I
haven't written it the code to compose a full document string. It will
probably come shortly, but if you would find it helpful, a patch will be
welcome. :)
