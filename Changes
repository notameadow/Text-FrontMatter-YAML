Revision history for Text-FrontMatter-YAML

0.04    2013-06-02 (internal-only)
  - Removed ability to initialize from a file or a filehandle;
    this makes the code simpler, and File::Slurp, Path::Class, and the
    like make that feature more or less superfluous.
  - The 'string' parameter to new() is now 'from_string'.
  - The '---' marker lines are no longer returned by 'frontmatter_text'
  - A better distinction is made between *empty* sections and
    *undefined* sections. (See perldoc.)
  - Sped up collection of data section.

0.03    2013-05-27 (internal-only)

  - Assume input is in UTF-8 and set encoding on open()

0.02    2013-05-20
